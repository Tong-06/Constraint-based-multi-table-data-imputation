# Constraint-based Multi-table Data Imputation

## Documentations
- **Experiment Results (Textual)**: Detailed textual descriptions and analyses of the experiment outcomes.

## Figures
- **Experiment Results (Visual)**: Visual representations of the experiment results for intuitive understanding.

## Codes
- **impute.py**: Implements the proposed algorithm for multi-table data imputation.
- **compare.py**: Conducts comparative experiments between different imputation methods.
- **correlation.py**: Analyzes the correlation of data features to identify relationships.
- **precision**: Evaluates various metrics of the imputation results to assess accuracy.
- **draw.py**: Generates visualizations based on experiment results.

## Datasets
- **Multi-table Datasets**: The project includes three multi-table datasets:
  - **Original Tables**: Contains tables 1 to 6.
  - **Merged Datasets**: Includes three merged datasets (thyroid, heart, and obesity).
  - **Imputed Datasets**: Six datasets imputed using the proposed approximate algorithm and five classic single-table imputation algorithms.
